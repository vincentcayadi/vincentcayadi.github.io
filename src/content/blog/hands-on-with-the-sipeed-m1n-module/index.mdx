## Introduction

While researching for the **2025 RoboCup Junior Soccer Open**, I aimed to build a vision system with four cameras, each positioned 90 degrees apart, to provide full 360° field coverage. This required finding a camera module that was compact, affordable, and capable of meeting the following criteria:

- Processing speed comparable to the OpenMV H 7 (~480 MHz).
- Adequate RAM for image processing.
- At least one UART pin for communication.

### Initial Considerations

1. **Raspberry Pi Camera**  
   To use the Raspberry Pi camera, I would need a [CM4](https://detail.tmall.com/item.htm?id=630988806835&_u=m30vu5iq2a0a) and its [expansion board](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=670426091412&_u=m30vu5iq4b54), along with the [camera module](https://detail.tmall.com/item.htm?_u=m30vu5iqabca&id=611631113188). While this setup is undeniably powerful, it would involve installing a bare-metal Linux system (likely Arch Linux without a GUI) with OpenCV. Interfacing would rely on an Ethernet port, which adds unnecessary complexity. Beyond the high setup effort, this solution would also consume significant power and generate heat, making it unsuitable for a system requiring four cameras. Moreover, the high FPS output is unnecessary for my use case.

### Finding the Sipeed M 1 n Module

Eventually, I discovered a team using the [Sipeed M1n Module](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Sipeed-M1n-Module-AI-Development-Kit-based-on-K210-p-4491.html). According to Seeedstudio's description:

> This M 1 n AI module development kit is designed by Sipeed. The kit includes an M 1 n module, a Type-C to M.2 adapter, and a camera. The M 1 n module embeds the K 210 AI chip, which has a powerful CPU, NPU, and APU.

The Sipeed M 1 n's main selling points are its cost-effective camera module and compact design. Most of its features—such as AI processing—aren't relevant to my needs. I’m only interested in its speed and image-capturing capabilities, as my algorithm focuses on basic object detection without requiring advanced AI features.

Upon closer inspection, the Sipeed M 1 n camera looked strikingly similar to the OpenMV camera, yet it costs roughly six times less (at the time of writing).

### Side-by-Side Comparison

Here’s a comparison of the Sipeed M 1 n Module and OpenMV H 7:

| Feature                         | Sipeed M 1 n Module      | OpenMV H 7                      |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Cost (USD)**                  | $13.90                 | $79.90                         |
| **Processor (and clock speed)** | K 210 AI chip (400 MHz) | STM 32 H 743 (480 MHz)            |
| **Flash Storage**               | 16 MB                  | 32 MB External + 2 MB Internal |
| **RAM**                         | 8 MB                   | 32 MB (SDRAM) + 1 MB SRAM      |

Although the Sipeed M 1 n Module has a slightly lower clock speed and less memory, its affordability and simplicity make it an appealing choice for my project. Since my algorithm doesn’t require AI capabilities, the module's raw processing power is sufficient to handle the object detection tasks for RoboCup Junior Soccer Open.

### Initial Rant

Navigating the Sipeed website and its documentation was an absolute nightmare. The site felt like accessing raw server file storage with no proper front-end UI—just an overwhelming mess of links and files. Finding footprint for KiCAD was unnecessarily difficult due to poor organization and unclear file descriptions.

To make matters worse, the documentation provided zero clarity on the pinouts or their specific functions. I had to cross-reference multiple sources to figure out the basics. And don’t even get me started on the MaixPy IDE documentation—it was so poorly written that I initially didn’t even realize it supported macOS, which almost led me to abandon the camera altogether.

Want the links to the site? Nope. Go hunt them down yourself and experience the chaos firsthand

## Testing The Camera

Since FPS is the main important thing about using a new camera. I will just only test it via the fps metrics by how it runs when there is multiple objects ontop of trying to process the distances other stuff.
